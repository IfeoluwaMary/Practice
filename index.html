            <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Ifeoluwa, a graduate of Obafemi Awolowo University. I recently picked interest in the tech industry(front-end web developer) and started taking some basic courses( Python, HTML) early this month. I got into Future Academy Africa through scholarship, and I believe this program will guide me in the right direction needed to achieve the first milestone of being a good front-end developer.
            <p>Started calsses on 30<sup>th</sup> July, and it has being amazing. I have learnt alot in week 1. I am super excited I am doing this and determined to give the process my best.</p>
